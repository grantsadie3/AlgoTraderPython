# AlgoTrader
Library for a simulated crypto exchange account. With this library, you can download all historical price data binance has to offer, trade on real time prices with real assets using your binance account, setup email alerts as to when this happens, and much more. Please see my YouTube series for tutorials and instructions. Updates on this code will be released as the video tutorials are released.
